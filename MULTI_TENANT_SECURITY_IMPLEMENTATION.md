# Multi-Tenant Security Implementation

This document summarizes the changes made to implement proper multi-tenant security for the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in the HomeManager platform.

## Overview

The HomeManager platform is used by multiple organizations (tenants) who share the same backend infrastructure. Ensuring proper isolation between organizations is critical for security and data privacy. The following changes were made to strengthen the multi-tenant security model.

## Key Changes

### 1. Organization-Scoped Role Model

- Updated `OrganizationRole` model to inherit from `OrganizationModel` for automatic organization scoping:
  ```python
  class OrganizationRole(OrganizationModel):
      ...
  ```

- Changed role slug uniqueness constraint from system-wide to per-organization:
  ```python
  class Meta:
      ordering = ['name']
      unique_together = ('organization', 'slug')
  ```

### 2. ViewSet Security Enhancements

- Enhanced `OrganizationRoleViewSet` with proper organization filtering:
  ```python
  def get_queryset(self):
      """Filter roles to only show the user's organization roles"""
      user = self.request.user
      if user.is_superuser:
          return OrganizationRole.objects.all()
      
      if user.organization:
          return OrganizationRole.objects.filter(organization=user.organization)
      return OrganizationRole.objects.none()
  ```

- Added security to role creation with automatic organization assignment:
  ```python
  def perform_create(self, serializer):
      """Ensure new roles are associated with the user's organization"""
      if not self.request.user.is_superuser and self.request.user.organization:
          serializer.save(organization=self.request.user.organization)
      else:
          serializer.save()
  ```

- Added protection against changing a role's organization:
  ```python
  def perform_update(self, serializer):
      """Prevent organization switching for roles"""
      instance = self.get_object()
      if 'organization' in serializer.validated_data and serializer.validated_data['organization'] != instance.organization:
          if not self.request.user.is_superuser:
              raise ValidationError("You cannot change a role's organization")
      ...
  ```

### 3. Cross-Organization Protection

- Added validation in `OrganizationMembershipViewSet` to prevent assigning roles from one organization to memberships in another:
  ```python
  # Additional validation: ensure the role belongs to the same organization
  membership = serializer.instance
  if membership.role and membership.role.organization != membership.organization:
      membership.delete()  # Clean up the invalid membership
      raise ValidationError("The role must belong to the same organization as the membership")
  ```

### 4. Database Changes

- Created and applied migration `0003_organizationrole_organization_and_more.py` to:
  1. Add organization foreign key to OrganizationRole
  2. Remove system-wide unique constraint on role slugs
  3. Add per-organization unique constraint

### 5. Testing

- Created comprehensive unit tests to validate the multi-tenant security model:
  - `test_multi_tenant_security.py`: Tests isolation between organizations
  - `test_role_tenant_security.py`: Script to test via API endpoints

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Isolation**: All role-related operations are now properly scoped to the user's organization
2. **Permission Bypass Prevention**: Added checks to prevent assigning roles across organizations
3. **UI/API Security**: Both frontend and backend now enforce proper organization-scoped role management

## Next Steps

1. Run the entire test suite to verify that all components work together correctly
2. Monitor logs for any unexpected permission or organization-related errors
3. Consider adding organization ID validation in API serializers for deeper protection
4. Implement similar multi-tenant protections for other sensitive areas of the application

## Conclusion

These changes establish a robust multi-tenant security framework for the RBAC system, ensuring that organizations cannot access or modify data belonging to other organizations. The platform now enforces proper organization boundaries at multiple levels:

1. Data model constraints
2. API access controls
3. Cross-reference validations
4. Comprehensive testing

This implementation follows security best practices for multi-tenant systems and significantly reduces the risk of data leakage between organizations.
