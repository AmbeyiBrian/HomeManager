## Dependencies

The implemented screens rely on the following dependencies:
- `@react-native-picker/picker`: For dropdown selections
- `expo-image-picker`: For image selection functionality
- `react-native-qrcode-svg`: For QR code generation
- `expo-file-system`: For file operations
- `expo-media-library`: For saving files to device
- `expo-sharing`: For sharing functionality

## API Integration

Each screen includes commented code showing how to integrate with backend APIs. These placeholders should be replaced with actual API calls when the backend is ready.

## Navigation

All screens are properly connected in the app's navigation system in `App.js`.

## Next Steps

For future development:
1. Connect screens to actual API endpoints
2. Implement offline data synchronization
3. Add analytics and error tracking
4. Enhance UI with animations and transitions

## Data Storage Solution

The HomeManager app uses a hybrid storage approach to handle offline data:

- **SecureStore**: Used for sensitive data (token, user credentials) and small datasets (<2KB)
- **AsyncStorage**: Used for larger datasets like property listings, units, and payment histories

This approach solves the SecureStore 2KB limitation while maintaining security for sensitive information. The implementation includes:

1. Automatic data size detection
2. Transparent storage selection based on data size
3. Proper cleanup of both storage systems during logout
