# Organization Name Display Updates - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard (EnhancedDashboard.js)
- Updated useAuth to include `currentOrganization`
- Modified header to display organization name as main title
- Added "Dashboard Overview" as subtitle
- Format: Shows "{Organization Name}" with "Dashboard Overview" below

### 2. Navigation Component (Navigation.js)  
- Updated sidebar drawer to use `currentOrganization?.name` instead of hardcoded branding
- Already had proper organization name display in app bar
- Maintains fallback to branding defaults

### 3. Layout Component (Layout.js)
- Added useAuth import and currentOrganization destructuring
- Updated drawer title to show organization name
- Maintains "HomeManager" fallback for unauthenticated state

## Expected Behavior

When a user logs in:
1. Dashboard header shows "[Organization Name]" as main title
2. Navigation sidebar shows organization name in drawer
3. App bar shows organization name in main navigation
4. Falls back to "HomeManager" if no organization is set

## Technical Details

- Organization data comes from JWT token (`organization_name` claim)
- AuthContext properly extracts and provides `currentOrganization`
- All components use optional chaining for safety (`currentOrganization?.name`)
- Fallback mechanism ensures UI never shows empty/undefined

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/pages/EnhancedDashboard.js`
2. `/frontend/src/components/Navigation.js` 
3. `/frontend/src/components/Layout.js`

## Testing

Run the frontend and verify:
- Dashboard shows org name in header
- Navigation shows org name in sidebar  
- All fallbacks work properly
- No console errors related to organization display
