# Organization Filtering Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to ensure that all API endpoints in the HomeManager application filter data based on the user's organization, implementing proper multi-tenant security.

## Changes Made

### 1. OrganizationRoleViewSet

The `OrganizationRoleViewSet` was updated to:
- Filter roles by the user's organization in `get_queryset`
- Set the organization when creating a new role in `perform_create`
- Ensure users can only update roles from their organization in `perform_update`

### 2. ServiceProviderViewSet

The `ServiceProviderViewSet` was updated to:
- Add an `organization` field to the `ServiceProvider` model
- Update the `get_queryset` method to filter by organization instead of owner
- Update the `perform_create` method to set both owner and organization when creating a provider

### 3. Data Migration

A custom management command (`update_service_providers`) was created to:
- Identify existing `ServiceProvider` records without an organization
- Associate them with their owner's organization
- Report on the migration results

## Testing

A comprehensive testing script was created to verify that all endpoints correctly filter by organization:
- `test_organization_filtering.py`: Tests all API endpoints to ensure they return only data for the user's organization
- `test_org_filtering.bat`: Batch file to simplify running the tests

## Security Benefits

These changes ensure:
1. Complete data isolation between organizations
2. Prevention of cross-organization data access 
3. Consistent behavior across all API endpoints

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Testing**: Run the organization filtering test script after any API changes
2. **Code Reviews**: Ensure all new ViewSets implement proper organization filtering
3. **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of the multi-tenant security model
