# QR Code API Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the QR code API endpoints for use with the mobile app's QR Code Manager feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created QR Code API Endpoints

Created two new API endpoints in `views_qr.py`:

1. `bulk_qr_codes`: Fetches QR codes for multiple units at once
   - URL: `/api/properties/qr-codes/bulk/?units=1,2,3,4`
   - Requires authentication
   - Returns base64-encoded QR codes for each unit

2. `property_qr_codes`: Fetches QR codes for all units in a property
   - URL: `/api/properties/{property_id}/qr-codes/`
   - Requires authentication
   - Returns base64-encoded QR codes for each unit in the property

### 2. Created Permission Classes

Implemented custom permission classes in `permissions.py`:

- `IsPropertyManager`: Checks if user has manager access to properties
- `IsPropertyOwner`: Checks if user is the owner of properties

These permission classes were implemented with simplified logic since the organization roles system wasn't immediately accessible.

### 3. Updated URLs Configuration

Added the new endpoints to `urls.py`:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
    # New QR code endpoints for bulk operations
    path('qr-codes/bulk/', views_qr.bulk_qr_codes, name='bulk-qr-codes'),
    path('properties/<int:pk>/qr-codes/', views_qr.property_qr_codes, name='property-qr-codes'),
]
```

## Testing

Created a test script (`test_qr_endpoints.py`) to verify the API endpoints work correctly.

## Mobile App Integration

The mobile app's `QRCodeManagerScreen.js` was updated to:

1. Use the bulk QR codes API when online
2. Fall back to local QR generation when offline or if API fails
3. Handle potential error scenarios gracefully

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the endpoints thoroughly with actual data
2. **Security Review**: Ensure proper access controls are in place
3. **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching QR codes for frequently accessed properties
4. **Mobile Integration**: Verify mobile app properly interacts with the new endpoints
